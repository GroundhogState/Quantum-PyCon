# Quantum-PyCon
A lightning talk on use of actual quantum devices with Python.

Did you know you can use existing python libraries to run jobs on actual quantum computers right now? I think this is absolutely amazing, and I want to show you how to do exactly that.

Before we get there, here's a why you should care about quantum computing.
* Buzzword city
* Speedups
* Security
* Simulation
* "The search for a killer app" 

Everything you need to know about quantum computing in thirty seconds:
* The basic unit is a qubit - exists in a mix of 0/1, but you just get one when you measure
* Entanglement is a resource for quantum information processing
* Maintaining coherence is a central challenge for qubit devices
* Circuit model of quantum computing


* Submitting a job to Rigetti with PennyLane: Grover Search?

* Demon-spawn of buzzwords: Quantum machine learning
	* Here's one I prepared earlier: 

* Happy entangling
